# Sprint Backlog – Recipe Suggestion Helper (CLI AI Chatbot)
**Project:** AIEG F25 Capstone  
**Sprint Goal:** Deliver a fully working CLI chatbot by Dec 12 that:
- Takes user ingredients → suggests 2–3 matching recipes from JSON
- Uses OpenAI/Claude for natural follow-up questions
- Feels smooth and natural in the terminal

- [ ] Add dietary filters (vegan, gluten-free, keto flags in JSON)
- [ ] Save favorite recipes to a simple JSON file

### How to Use This Backlog in GitHub
1. Turn each row into a GitHub Issue → assign the owner + label (e.g., `backend`, `prompt`, `ui`, `qa`)
2. Or import directly into **GitHub Projects (beta)** as a table view
3. Drag tasks into To Do → In Progress → Done as you go!
